Here is my project for Block-Tech. Read [Wiki](https://github.com/xiaonanpols21/block-tech-v2/wiki) for further information.

## Who are you?

My name is Xiao Nan Pols. I am 20 years old, and I am at the HvA studying CMD (Communication Multimedia Design). I am currently in my 2nd year. 

## What are you going to do?

For project Tech I am going to make a matching application to connect you with your favorite kdramas. 

## What is your concept?

I am going to make a kdrama matching application where you can find kdramas and add them to your list. I choose for kdramas because I watch it a lot myself. I have a personal band with this project so that I can be motivated to work on this project.

## How can you use your application?

When you come on the homepage, you choose a profile and add kdramas to your list. 

## Installation

Before you install the application, make sure to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your computer.
